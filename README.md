# CLI_Pathfinder_Character_Generator

## Welcome to the Pathfinder Character Generator.

### In this cli, you will choose your character's name, race, and class. This CLI project uses web scraping to locate informaion about classes and races. You can pull up your character sheet any time after assigning a class and race to your character. You will find some basic details from both classes and races in your character sheet as well as the ability to choose to see more information from either.

### Please make sure you have Nokogiri and Open-URI installed for the scraping portion of this CLI
